# SALSA - *SALesforce Scanner for Aura (and beyond)*

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/logo.jpeg" width="150">

**SALSA** has been developped on a lot of my personal free time, to help me on pentesting and bug hunting activites against Salesforce Lightning (Aura) and API assets. Please note it is fully experimental.

I decided to share it for free, to help the community.  
*If you would ever like to buy me a coffee or a beer* üòá :

## Features

- Enumeration and/or dump data records (*and sub-records*) from:
  - Aura controllers
  - Services API (Direct sObjects `/services/data/v60.0/sobjects` or SOQL `/services/data/v60.0/query/`)
  - SOAP (`/services/Soap/c/`)
- Works as unauthenticated or authenticated user (*username / password or `sid` or `aura.token`*).
- Enumeration records entities types (with or without custom entities `*__c` filtering) from:  
  - Target APIs harvesting
  - And/or Salesforce packages reflections
  - And/or encountered entities in the wild
- Test for targetted record identifier.
- Bruteforcing record identifiers.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatized test for arbitrary records creation.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatized test for arbitrary records fields edition.
- *And more: routing to HTTP proxy for investigation, custom User-Agent, automatized finding of entities fields, auto-detect FWUID, etc.*

‚ö†Ô∏è: *dangerous & experimental*

## Current limitations

- SOAP `query` requests are limited to 10 items.
- Bruteforcing IDs is limited to 10 items.

## TODO

*Release date: maybe one day*

- [ ] Find & add alternatives authentications.
- [ ] Detect `debug` mode arbitrary activation ([https://www.cosades.com/posts/sf_debug_mode](https://www.cosades.com/posts/sf_debug_mode)).  
- [ ] Download item for *Document* type identifier (hit `https://ATTACHMENTS_DOMAIN/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/<id>` - *URL can also be found in `Generic_DocumentDownloadPathUrl` attribute from descriptor `serviceComponent://ui.comm.runtime.components.aura.components.siteforce.controller.PubliclyCacheableComponentLoaderController/ACTION$getPageComponent`*)  
- [ ] Data API - Composite: `/services/data/vXX.0/composite/batch` (POST, with examples parameters: `{"batchRequests": [{"method": "PATCH", "url": "v38.0/sobjects/OpportunityLineItem/<ID>", "richInput": {"End_Date__c": "2017-01-19"}]}}`)  
- [ ] Data API - Anonymous APEX execution: `/services/data/vXX.0/tooling/executeAnonymous/?anonymousBody=`
- [ ] Async API - Job: `/services/async/xx.0/job` (POST and `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><jobInfo xmlns="http://www.force.com/2009/06/asyncapi/dataload"><operation>update</operation><object>OpportunityLineItem</object><contentType>CSV</contentType></jobInfo>` or `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><jobInfo xmlns="http://www.force.com/2009/06/asyncapi/dataload"><state>Closed</state></jobInfo>`). Other related endpoints: `/services/data/v60.0/jobs/query`, `/services/async/xx.0/job/JOBID`,  `/services/async/xx.0/job/JOBID/batch`, `/services/async/xx.0/job/JOBID/batch/BATCHID/result`
- [ ] Apex REST API: `/services/apexrest/SoapMessage`, `/services/apexrest/Cases`
- [ ] Find the parameters for other classic Aura controllers ü•π

## Troubleshooting

> **Disclaimer: "spaghetti code" here, due to Salesforce technical contexts discoveries, mixed between official documentations, write-ups, reverse engineering, empirical tests. Hence I could study for small new features proposals or major bug fixes, this tool is now hard to maintain.**

***Then, before opening an issue, please consider the following points:***

1. I strongly encourage you to **switch the logging level** to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` level (`--debug` / `--trace`).
2. The tool can send **thousand of requests** and **works for hours**. Two possible consequences:

- **You can be banned** by the target.
- **The authentication could have a short expiration time on your target**. *I do not know how to detect & manage that part, there is no real homogeneous behaviour for this.* I could only suggest you to reduce the record types to test.

3. I think the tool is adapted to most of Salesforce contexts, **but not all of them**.
4. Route the tool **an HTTP proxy** for further investigation (`--proxy 127.0.0.1:8080` for instance)

## Q/A

*Why is the authentication username/password does not work ?*

> Because the target is maybe not using the Aura Controller `apex://LightningLoginFormController/ACTION$login`: prefer using the `sid` (session id) or `token` (Aura token) after a manual authentication.  

*What's is the difference between `sid` and `token` ?*

> The `token` is used for authenticated Aura controller interactions. The `sid` is used to interact with other APIs. The format are not the same though: for the `token` it is more like a JWT, for the `sid` it is prefixed by the organization identifier.

*Why there are limitations regarding the amount of data dump in queries for example ?*

> Yes, it could be improved with new arguments. The initial reason was that the tool can launch thousand of requests and could last for hours (Entities count / fields cound / controllers count / services count / etc.). The limitations are present to reduce the duration. Feel free to change that.

*How do I find targets ?*

> It is up to you, but it can be done with nuclei: `nuclei -rl 10 -t "http/misconfiguration/salesforce-aura.yaml" -l subdomains.txt`

*Why the source code is so complex ? Why Java ?*

> In the beginning it was a clean set of small scripts. Discoveries after discoveries, I have added, modified, removed some parts. Without unit tests. And Salesforce contexts are very complex / customisable, targets behaviors can differ and code is adapted with some unelegant if/then/else. The last reason is that I wanted to have the most adaptable and automatized tool for this kind of assessment. I dig into complex workflows, but abandonned some steps. Why Java ? Because Salesforce APEX is very close to Java, and Salesforce have some libraries in Java which could be decompiled to be dynamically integrated into the tool. And I like Java (nobody is perfect).
